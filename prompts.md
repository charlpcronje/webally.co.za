Sometimes it's difficult for an AI like yourself to keep context of the entire project, because you run out of context size. So what I want you to do so that you will always be able to continue in the next context window is to create all the files that we need for this entire project. But I don't want you to put any coding or markup in any of the files. All I wanted to do is put TODO's in all the files. 
So every little thing we need to do in every file, So that if I would give you any of those files in future context windows that you will be able to finish the file / html / code / css or what ever.
So if you created detailed enough TODO's then every file should be self explanatory. 

At the beginning of each response list all the the global index of the system by adding listing all the classes / methods / functions / html elements / components with their arguments and types for the previous response after the continuation of the completed file You can do that by maybe creating Pseudo interfaces for all of different coding structures.  Will you please describe to me what you understand from what I just told you.
<rules_fo_ coding>
* Add the relative path and file name on the first line of each file in comments
* If an artifact was cut short in the previous response by the character limit then Always continue the next response by beginning exactly where it stopped in the previous response.
* Allways provide as much output as possible until you reach character limit. 
<todo_phase>
The TODOs must contain everything that must must be done in each and every file
a TODO can never represent anything larger than a single function
a TODO must contain the structure name. Ex: class name, method name, function name
a What to export and import can be one todo each
a When a TODO represents a function / method it must contain the argument and return types
If a TODO describes a part of layout or template it must name the block of code and name all the elements that must be created with emmet
Each tailwind class that is applied
</todo_phase>
<implementation_phase>
- Always give production-ready code only. 
- Always add comments to all classes, methods, and functions with the argument - types and return types. 
- When it's JavaScript, add JS docs to everything. 
- Make sure that all errors are handled in all code. 
- Do not leave any placeholders ever. No placeholders. 
- Do not omit any code ever. Only give full production-ready code that can be - copied and pasted to work.
</implementation_phase>
<commands>
The following are all regarding creating interfaces that include for 
* imports, 
* exports, 
* functions, 
* objects, 
* classes, 
* methods 
* and all other structures
/index: [all, prev_resp, cur_resp, prev_artifact, auto]: Generate interfaces 
all: all artifacts
prev_resp: for all artifacts in the previous response
cur_resp: for all  artifacts in the previous response current response
prev_artifact: for previous artifact
auto: after each artifact auto create the interfaces for the previous artifact and keep on doing so until a different option is chosen 
/tree: Create a file tree of all the files in the project in a code block and add a ✅emoji next to generated files
✖️emoji next to files that us yet to be generated
💯additional emoji for files that is production ready
⁉️additional emoji for files that contain comments for all structures
🆘additional emoji error handling added to file

/reason: To reason about something, come up with 3 solutions to the problem. Rate each solution out of 10, with 3 criteria of your choosing, and give it an average score allowing for 2 decimals. If you feel that there's still better solutions, then create another 3, and also rate them the same way. Then after that, choose the best 2 solutions with highest rating, and iterate on both of them. Then after that, create the final code for the solution with the highest rating.
</commands>

<IMPORTANT>
Im going to ask you to restart if the TODO's  are not detailed enough to describe so that the file would be created without any context given with it, that is what it should be able to do, each file should be self contained, needing no additional explanation or context
The TODO's are also way to broad if it is like "TODO: Implement any necessary Svelte logic for dynamic content" This will contain multiple functions, which is not cool, it should be at the max 1 function per todo with he name of the structure

If there are context to refer to like an uploaded design,then at the beginning of the file in comments refer to the attached content that should be attached again ion a new context window so that it does not refer to nothing on a new context windw
</IMPORTANT>
</rules_fo_ coding>

I understand your request. You want me to create a comprehensive set of TODO comments for each file in the project, without actually implementing any code. These TODOs should be detailed enough that they could guide the implementation of each file without additional context. Here's a summary of what you're asking:

1. Create all necessary files for the project.
2. Fill each file with detailed TODO comments instead of actual code.
3. Each TODO should represent no more than a single function or component.
4. TODOs should include structure names, argument types, return types, and specific implementation details.
5. For layout or template TODOs, include element names and Tailwind classes.
6. At the beginning of each response, list a global index of classes, methods, functions, components, etc.
7. Include the relative path and filename at the start of each file.
8. Continue artifacts that were cut short in previous responses.
9. Provide as much output as possible until reaching the character limit.

You've also provided a set of commands for generating interfaces, creating file trees, listing classes/methods/functions/components, and explaining or reasoning about specific parts of the code.

For the implementation phase, you've specified that all code should be production-ready, fully commented, error-handled, and without placeholders.

Is this understanding correct? Would you like me to proceed with creating the TODO-filled files for your webAlly project based on this approach?

---

Please continue, but number 6 should be to only list a global index of classes, methods, functions, components, etc. of the files in the previous response not globally
Below is an example of what I do not want, here is what is wrong with is
<!-- src/routes/+layout.svelte -->
Add a description what this layout is for

<!-- TODO: Import necessary Svelte components -->
name the the components
<!-- TODO: Import global styles -->
which global styles, you do not know yet then make a NOTE: Remember to add global styles when known and this NOTE must persist in the implementation until it is fukfilled

<!-- TODO: Create main layout structure using <slot> -->
<!-- TODO: Include Header component -->
Make sub-todo's for all the functions 
<!-- TODO: Include Footer component -->
Make sub-todo's for all the functions 
<!-- TODO: Implement any necessary Svelte logic for layout-wide functionality -->
NOTE: Add Svelte logic for layout if not known yet

Please continue, but number 6 should be to only list a global index of classes, methods, functions, components, etc. of the files in the previous response not globally
Below is an example of what I do not want, here is what is wrong with is
<!-- src/routes/+layout.svelte -->
Add a description what this layout is for

<!-- TODO: Import necessary Svelte components -->

<!-- TODO: Include Footer component -->
Make sub-todo's for all the functions 
<!-- TODO: Implement any necessary Svelte logic for layout-wide functionality -->
NOTE: Add Svelte logic for layout if not known yet

I understand. Thank you for the clarification. I'll adjust my approach to make the TODOs more specific and detailed, focusing on individual functions and components. I'll also ensure that the global index only lists items from the previous response. Let's start with the layout file:

<!-- src/routes/+layout.svelte -->

```svelte
<!-- 
This layout serves as the main structure for all pages in the webAlly website.
It includes the header, main content area, and footer.
-->

<!-- TODO: Import Header component from '../components/Header.svelte' -->
<!-- TODO: Import Footer component from '../components/Footer.svelte' -->
<!-- NOTE: Remember to import global styles when defined -->

<!-- TODO: Create main layout structure -->
<!-- TODO: Function: createMainLayout() -->

<!-- TODO: Implement responsive sidebar for mobile navigation -->
<!-- TODO: Function: toggleMobileSidebar() -->

<!-- NOTE: Add additional Svelte logic for layout-wide functionality as needed -->
```

-->

<!-- TODO: Import necessary Svelte modules (onMount, createEventDispatcher) -->

<!-- TODO: Define props -->
<!-- TODO: Prop: currentPath (type: string) -->

<!-- TODO: Style header using Tailwind classes -->
<!--   - Apply styles for logo, navigation items, and CTA button -->
<!--   - Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop views -->
```

Now, let's create the TODO list for the Footer component:

<!-- src/components/Footer.svelte -->

```svelte
<!-- 
This component represents the footer of the webAlly website,
including the logo, links, contact button, and social media icons.
-->

<!-- TODO: Import necessary Svelte modules (if required) -->

<!-- TODO: Create footer structure -->
<!-- TODO: Function: createFooterStructure() -->
<!--   - Parameters: none -->
<!--   - Returns: void -->
<!--   - Description: Creates footer HTML structure with logo, links, contact button, and social icons -->

<!-- TODO: Implement footer links -->
<!-- TODO: Function: createFooterLinks() -->
<!--   - Parameters: none -->
<!--   - Returns: Array<{text: string, href: string}> -->
<!--   - Description: Returns an array of footer link items -->

<!-- TODO: Implement social media icons -->
<!-- TODO: Function: createSocialIcons() -->
<!--   - Parameters: none -->
<!--   - Returns: Array<{icon: string, href: string, alt: string}> -->
<!--   - Description: Returns an array of social media icon data -->

<!-- TODO: Implement contact button functionality -->
<!-- TODO: Function: handleContactClick() -->
<!--   - Parameters: none -->
<!--   - Returns: void -->

<!-- TODO: Implement current year display -->
<!-- TODO: Function: getCurrentYear() -->
<!--   - Parameters: none -->
<!--   - Returns: number -->
<!--   - Description: Returns the current year for the copyright notice -->
```

These TODO lists provide more specific guidance for implementing each component, including function names, parameters, return types, and descriptions. They also include notes for styling with Tailwind and implementing responsive design.

Now, after reviewing the entire context, here are some observations and recommendations:

1. Missed TODOs:
   - We didn't create TODOs for individual project pages in the Portfolio section. Consider adding a `ProjectDetails.svelte` component and corresponding route.
   - We should add TODOs for implementing a dark mode toggle in the Header component.
   - Add TODOs for implementing internationalization (i18n) if the website needs to support multiple languages.

2. Incomplete NOTEs:
   - In the `+layout.svelte` file, we had a NOTE about adding global styles. You should import the `global.css` file in this layout component.
   - For the Svelte logic in the layout, consider implementing a store for managing global state (e.g., dark mode, current route).

3. Additional considerations:
   - Add TODOs for implementing error boundaries and 404 pages.
   - Create TODOs for setting up CI/CD pipelines and deployment scripts.
   - Add TODOs for implementing automated testing (unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests).

To address these points, you should:

1. Create the missing components and add corresponding TODOs.
2. Update the `+layout.svelte` file to import global styles and implement global state management.
3. Add the suggested additional TODOs to the appropriate files or create new files for them.

Lastly, ensure that you have a plan for content creation, especially for the Research and Portfolio sections, as these will require regular updates to keep the website fresh and engaging.

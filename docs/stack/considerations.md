# Tech Stack Considerations
Given your requirements for a company website that includes server and client-side dynamic pages, theming, layout, Markdown content management, and the ability to execute Python scripts along with API calls, here are the best options to consider:
### SvelteKit

- **Dynamic Pages**: SvelteKit is designed for building dynamic applications with server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side routing, making it ideal for your needs.
  
- **Markdown Support**: You can easily integrate Markdown for content pages using packages like `@sveltejs/kit` or other Markdown libraries. This allows you to write content in Markdown and render it seamlessly.

- **Theming and Layout**: SvelteKit supports layouts and theming through Svelte components, enabling you to create reusable UI components and apply consistent styles across your application.

- **API Integration**: SvelteKit allows you to make API calls from both the server and client sides. You can create endpoints in the `src/routes/api` directory to handle backend logic and communicate with your Python scripts.

- **Python Execution**: For executing Python scripts, you can set up a backend service (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI) and communicate with it via API calls from your SvelteKit app.

### Nuxt

- **Dynamic Pages**: Nuxt.js is another solid choice, especially if you prefer Vue.js. It offers excellent support for SSR and dynamic routing.

- **Markdown Support**: Nuxt has modules like `@nuxt/content` and `@nuxtjs/mdc` that allow you to render Markdown content easily, with features like syntax highlighting and component integration.

- **Theming and Layout**: Nuxt provides a flexible layout system and supports Vue components, making it easy to manage theming.

- **API Integration**: Similar to SvelteKit, you can create API endpoints in Nuxt and handle server-side logic.

- **Python Execution**: Like with SvelteKit, you can set up a separate backend service for Python and integrate it with your Nuxt application.

### Conclusion

Considering the need for a robust solution, **SvelteKit** stands out as the most suitable option for the project. It offers a modern approach to building web applications with excellent support for dynamic content, Markdown, and theming while allowing for easy integration with Python scripts and APIs. 

I am comfortable with Vue.js, **Nuxt** as well and is a great alternative, but SvelteKit's simplicity and performance will provide a better development experience for my specific needs.
